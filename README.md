# Kevin Rush Portfolio Website üåü

Excited to share my sleek and responsive portfolio website! üöÄ

This project was a hands-on way to learn **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **TypeScript**, inspired by the incredible [compiletab tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63mEm3AMSY&t=29s). Their stunning design choices, like gradient backgrounds and typography, were the perfect foundation for creating a captivating website.
